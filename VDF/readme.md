# Building the VDF archive
In order to generate a complete archive with all of the necessary files to use **YAGA**, open up the powershell command line in this directory and run this command:
```
./vdfsbuilder.exe build.vm
```
This will produce the `yaga.vdf` file that you can later copy to **YOUR_GAME_PATH/Data**.
